\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The aim of this work is to gain insight into the modelling of systems via Finite State Machines (FSMs) and to understand the principles behind their implementation in the context of autonomous vehicles.

At first, a brief overview of the concepts of FSMs comprehensive of simple examples is provided.
Then, the focus will shift to the modelling of a simple application, namely a parking gate system, which will be designed using FSMs.

\paragraph{Tools}

As for the tools used, \texttt{Simulink}, and in particular \texttt{Simulink/Stateflows}, is employed as the main tool for implementing the FSM and simulating the system.
On the other hand, \texttt{MATLAB} is simply used to plot the results of the simulation.
