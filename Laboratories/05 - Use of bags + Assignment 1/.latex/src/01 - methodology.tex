\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The aim of this work is to gain insight into the use of \texttt{rosbags} for the analysis of data collected by autonomous vehicles.

The following sections will provide a detailed description of the requests associated with this assignment, the approach taken to fulfill them, and the discussion of the results obtained.

\paragraph{Tools}

As for the tools used, \texttt{ROS1} (Robot Operating System) was employed as the main framework for data collection, while their analysis was performed using \texttt{MATLAB}.
Notice that with the current setup used by the author, \texttt{MATLAB 2024a} was running in Windows 10, while \texttt{ROS1} was running in the \texttt{WSL2} (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment, specifically in \texttt{Ubuntu 20.04}.
