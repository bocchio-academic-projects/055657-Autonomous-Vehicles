\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The aim of this work is to gain insight into the implementation of some of the most basic grid-based planning algorithms, specifically the \texttt{Dijkstra} and \texttt{A*} algorithms.

The following sections will provide a detailed description of the requests associated with this assignment, the approach taken to fulfill them, and the discussion of the results obtained.

\paragraph{Tools}

As for the tools used, \texttt{MATLAB} is employed as the main platform for implementing the algorithms and performing the analysis of the data collected during the simulation.
