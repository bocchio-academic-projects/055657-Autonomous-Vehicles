\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this short report, we have presented the results of the first assignment of the course on Autonomous Vehicles.
We have shown how to analyze data collected by a simulated robot in a Gazebo environment, using the \texttt{rosbag} command to store the data.
We have also demonstrated how to estimate the control commands sent to the robot during the simulation, and how to evaluate their accuracy by comparing trajectories and odometer readings.

Results obtained show that the estimated commands are representative of the original ones, but not completely overlapping due to poor timing performance caused (probably) by the \texttt{WSL2} environment that can't fully afford the real-time performance required by the simulation.

Further investigations and testing could be done by switching to a native \texttt{Linux} environment, which could provide better performance and more accurate results.
